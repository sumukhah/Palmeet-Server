# **PalMeet**

**What problems are we facing today?**

People are having several meetings at different times in a day. It became difficult to track the exact date, time, and availability of your team.

When we want to start a meeting we need to check the availability of every individual member.

After creating a meeting, we need to share meeting credentials with every member. We use platforms like Whatsapp, Gmail e.t.c

When the meeting is about to start, it takes a long time to search for meeting credentials that may be mixed up in chats. Sometimes the timing of the meetings may overlap without the knowledge.

**What google calendar, microsoft calendar is not doing?**

You cannot check for availability of your team.You can only set a reminder about a meeting.
 It won&#39;t warn if multiple meetings overlap.
 It won&#39;t help you sharing meeting credentials.

**Solution we are building:**

Every user will have an upcoming meeting list with the meeting credentials.

Admin or meeting host can create a group of people (with group names like &quot;Backend people&quot;, &quot;Frontend people&quot;). Group invitation will be sent to every member, and they will become group-member if they approve the invitation. The admin can check for the availability of the group members at a given time(say 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM). And it will display all available and non-available members. Then he can send meeting credentials for available members.

Every member gets this invitation, If a member accepts a meeting, It will be added to the upcoming meeting list.

# **Mobile applications**

# will be very helpful to achieve this.
